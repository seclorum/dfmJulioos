# Julia implementation of the DFM1 filter, emulating the Korg MS20 filter
# Original C code is included in comments where applicable for reference

# Original C structure for the filter:
# typedef struct {
#     double sample_rate;
#     double cutoff;
#     double resonance;
#     double drive;
#     double input_state;
#     double low_state;
#     double high_state;
#     double band_state;
# } DFM1;

# Define the DFM1 filter structure in Julia
mutable struct DFM1

    cutoff::Float64            # Cutoff frequency
    resonance::Float64         # Resonance amount
    drive::Float64             # Drive amount
    input_state::Float64       # Previous input state
    low_state::Float64         # Low-pass filter state
    high_state::Float64        # High-pass filter state
    band_state::Float64        # Band-pass filter state
